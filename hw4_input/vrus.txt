Overall MISSION

To harness the data revolution to further our understanding of how people learn, how to improve adaptive instructional systems (AISs), and how to make emerging learning ecologies that include online and blended learning with AISs more effective, efficient, engaging, equitable, relevant, and affordable. See the NSF-funded Learner Data Institute award: The Learner Data Institute: Harnessing The Data Revolution To Make The Learning Ecosystem More Effective, Efficient, and Engaging (Currently Funded Amount: $2,584,309.00; 2019-2021; Phase 2: 15 million for 5 years – to be applied for); https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1934745&HistoricalAwards=false). www.learnerdatainstitute.org

SHORT BIO

Dr. Rus is a Professor of Computer Science at The University of Memphis where he also heads the Data Science Research Cluster, a university-wide effort to define and pursue a vision for data science research, education, and outreach, as well as the Masters of Science in Data Science program. Dr. Rus has served in other leadership and administrative roles such as Graduate Coordinator in Computer Science, chairing faculty and instructor search committees, faculty senator, chairing the university-wide Faculty Policies committee, College Tenure and Promotion committee, Graduate Admissions committee, and chairing the Faculty Awards committee. Dr. Rus' academic career accomplishments are numerous including a professorship, several best paper awards (all of them with my advisees), and multi-million federally funded grants. Dr. Rus has a joint position in Computer Science and the Institute for Intelligent Systems where he has been interacting with Cognitive Scientists on developing adaptive educational technologies. He is also a Research Fellow of the Fedex Institute of Technology. Dr. Rus' research interests are at the intersection of human and machine learning and intelligent interactive systems. His overall research goal is to harness the data revolution to make the learning ecosystem more effective, equitable, engaging, efficient, relevant, and affordable. More specifically, Dr. Rus combines machine learning, statistical, and computational linguistics techniques to infer models that take advantage of the rich (large and diverse) sources of data available to address big challenges in the learning ecosystem. He has been developing advanced, optimized models from structured, semi-structured, and free-structure, i.e. text, data collections using both supervised and unsupervised techniques. For instance, Dr. Rus has been exploring Bayesian methods through the development of hierarchical models, sequential data models based on Hidden Markov Models, Maximum Entropy Models, Conditional Random Fields, reinforcement learning approaches, statistical relational methods such as Markov Logic, and deep neural network models, as well as unsupervised, semi-supervised, co-training, and active learning methods. Dr. Rus focuses on two broad impact applications which are both a type of intelligent interactive systems: dialogue-based intelligent tutoring systems and carebots (healthcare bots – this is a new application area he is moving into). Dr. Rus has served in various roles (PI or co-PI) on research projects funded by the National Science Foundation, Department of Defense, Department of Education, and private companies, and produced more than 150 peer-reviewed publications in major venues. For instance, he is currently a PI and co-PI on FOUR major NSF grants totaling $7,185,962.00

Dr. Rus received a very prestigious NSF award called The Learner Data Institute ($2.588 milion; 2020-2021) to lay the foundation of a Data Science institute for learner data. The Learner Data Institute's mission is to harness the data revolution to further our understanding of how people learn, how to improve adaptive instructional systems (AISs), and how to improve the learning ecosystem's effectiveness and cost-efficiency as well as learners and instructors' engagement and satisfaction while learning with technology.

Rajendra Banjade won 1st Place at the Annual Student Research Forum (2017).

Dr. Rus and Dr. Stefanescu won BEST PAPER AWARD at the 2nd International Conference on Smart Learning Environment (ICSLE 2015) for their paper entitled "Towards Non-Intrusive Assessment in Dialogue-based Intelligent. Tutoring Systems". An extended journal version has been published [PDF] .

Our team, NeRoSim, has won the semantic textual similarity competition at SemEval-2015, the premier forum for semantic evaluation. We participated in two tasks: the English semantic textual similarity (STS) task and the interpretable STS task. We WON both the English STS task and the interpretable STS task. See details in the organizers' report, which is available here. Note that for the English STS task we were ranked 10th out of 74 system runs but there was no significant difference among the top 10 system runs as the organizers' report clearly states. For the interpretable STS we were ranked 1st for the 'Headlines' data and 2nd for the 'Images' data, which is the best performance overall (for both datasets) of any team. For whatever reasons, the organizers did not report overall ranking for the whole interpretable STS - they chose to report results separately on the Headlines and Images data subsets for the interpretable STS task.

We proudly announce the release of SEMILAR: The Semantic Similarity Toolkit. See it here: SEMILAR.
