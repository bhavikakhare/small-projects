Incredible Yachts of the Rich and Famous

Updated: Aug 30, 2021By Louise MadisonBusiness

If there’s one expensive toy the rich and famous strive to save up for, it’s undoubtedly a yacht. These luxury cities-on-the-sea can cost upwards of tens of millions of dollars – with some superyachts even escalating into the hundreds of millions.

With such a hefty price tag, it takes someone with massive wealth, like Bill Gates of Microsoft fame, to be able to afford such open ocean opulence. On top of employing a small crew of nautical experts full-time to maintain (and navigate) the vessels, the fundamental cost of fuel alone is more than most will pay for college. Many yacht owners and charters also go the extra mile of supercharging their yachts with all kinds of bells and whistles. Let’s take a look at the most incredible (and incredibly expensive) yachts out there, owned by titans of industry from all over the globe.

Name: Va Bene Value: $10 million* Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Eric Clapton owns no less than four of the world’s most expensive guitars – along with one of the world’s most elite superyachts. Dubbed Va Bene, Clapton’s impressive sea vessel was built in the early 1990s by legendary designer Richard Hein. Clapton paid an estimated $10 million to buy it in 2005.

Va Bene is outfitted with twin Caterpillar engines capable of a top speed of 18 knots. Featuring enough cabin space for 25 passengers (including 13 crew members), Clapton actually added additional upgrades including a master suite, jet skis, and kayaks. And with an estimated net worth hovering around $250 million, Va Bene’s $10 million price tag is a relative drop in the bucket for one of music’s most revered (and profitable) icons. In fact, Clapton consistently ranks among the top dozen richest musicians who ever lived.
